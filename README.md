# Pyst Engine Command Syntax

The following is the format of a Pyst Engine command.  The first element is the core, which represents what subsystem processes this command.  The second is the asset, which is what set of assets does this command effect.  And lastly the function which is what function the core should perform on this asset or asset group.

	[core].[asset].[function]
